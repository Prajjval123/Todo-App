# Todo App with Redux and Local Storage
This repository contains a simple Todo application built with React, Redux, and local storage for state persistence. The application allows users to add, toggle, delete, and mark todos as completed or incomplete. It also supports filtering todos based on their completion status and searching for todos by text.

# Features
- Add Todos: Users can add new todos with a text description.
- Toggle Todos: Mark todos as completed or incomplete.
- Delete Todos: Remove todos from the list.
- Mark All Completed: Mark all todos as completed.
- Filter Todos: Filter todos based on their completion status.
- Search Todos: Search for todos by text.
- Local Storage Persistence: The application's state, including todos, filter, and search term, is saved to local storage. This ensures that the state is preserved across browser sessions.
